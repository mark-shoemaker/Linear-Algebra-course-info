            <title>Course Description</title>
            <p>
              Linear algebra is one of the most important subjects in mathematics, with applications everywhere from computer science to chemistry to economics to, most recently, machine learning and AI.  It has a very different feel from calculus and, for most students, takes some getting used to.  That said, it is a lot of fun and gives a small glimpse of the larger landscape of mathematics that is out there to learn.

        <title>Axioms</title>
        <p>
          Dr. Federico Ardila, a mathematician at San Francisco State University, developed a set of axioms for mathematics education.  I strongly support them, and so have copied them here.  
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

            </li>

            Course materials will be posted to or linked from Canvas. This may include notes, assignments, and practice exams. Announcements from the instructor will also be made through Canvas. You are responsible for reading Canvas announcements in a timely manner.

      <title>Participation and Attendance</title>
      <p>
        This is an in-person course and you are expected to attend all class session (unless you are sick in which case you should email me to let me know).  In addition to lectures, class time will be used for group work and in-class exercises.  This is one of the best ways to get practice with the type of problems that will be on the exams.
      </p>
      <p>
          Another component of your participation grade is office hours.  If you are struggling with any of the material, it is your responsibility to come to office hours so I can help clarify things. <em>If you come to office hours at least once in the first 4 weeks you will receive an extra point in the participation component of your grade.</em>

      <title>Homework</title>
      <p>
        The bulk of your grade in the class will be from webwork.  See the link above for how to log in to the webwork system. Homeworks will usually be due on Mondays, and will be roughly every week.

      <title>Exams</title>
      <p>
        This course will have two midterms and a final exam. The questions will be similar to questions you have seen on homeworks or in class.  The dates and times for these assessments are:

      Grades for the course will be curved at the end of the semester (most likely curved up). Because of how Canvas works, it is difficult to curve grades within that system, so any grades posted to Canvas will only reflect raw scores, not your actual letter grade.  If you have questions about how you're doing in the class at any time, come chat with me or send me an email.</p>
