It has a very different feel from calculus and, for most students, takes some getting used to. That said, it is a lot of fun and gives a small glimpse of the larger landscape of mathematics that is out there to learn.    Axioms  Dr. Federico Ardila, a mathematician at San Francisco State University, developed a set of axioms for mathematics education. I strongly support them, and so have copied them here.  Axiom 1  Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.    Axiom 2  Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.    Axiom 3  Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.    Axiom 4  Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.         Class Schedule     Meeting Times  Mon, Wed, Fri, 9:00 - 9:50 in Military Sciences 115        Office Hours  Mon, 10:00 - 11:00 AM and Wed, 1:00 - 2:00 PM in my office, Weber 128         Instructor Information      Name  Mark Shoemaker   Feel free to address me as Mark. My pronouns are he\/him\/his.     Title  Associate Professor of Mathematics    Email   mark.shoemaker@colostate.edu     Office  Weber 128        Textbook and Other Required Materials     Textbook  A First Course in Linear Algebra, by Ken Kuttler. There are many versions floating around online, so please use the copy linked to here .    You should read the relevant sections of the book ahead of class so you are prepared to follow the lectures.    Canvas  Course materials will be posted to or linked from Canvas. This may include notes, assignments, and practice exams. Announcements from the instructor will also be made through Canvas. You are responsible for reading Canvas announcements in a timely manner.    Webwork  Homework will be through webwork, which is, unfortunately, not connected to Canvas. To sign in, go to https:\/\/wuzzy.natsci.colostate.edu\/webwork2\/FA-MATH-369B . Your login name will be your netID and your initial password will be your CSU ID number.        Assessments   Participation and Attendance  This is an in-person course and you are expected to attend all class sessions (unless you are sick in which case you should email me to let me know). In addition to lectures, class time will be used for group work and in-class exercises. This is one of the best ways to get practice with the type of problems that will be on the exams.  Another component of your participation grade is office hours. If you are struggling with any of the material, it is your responsibility to come to office hours so I can help clarify things. If you come to office hours at least once in the first 4 weeks you will receive an extra point in the participation component of your grade.     Homework  The bulk of your grade in the class will be from webwork. See the link above for how to log in to the webwork system. Homeworks will usually be due on Mondays, and will be roughly every week.    Exams  This course will have two midterms and a final exam. The questions will be similar to questions you have seen on homeworks or in class. The dates and times for these assessments are:   Midterm I  Friday, September 26, 2025. In class.    Midterm II  Friday, October 31, 2025. In class.    Final Exam  The final will occur on Wednesday of finals week, 4:10-6:10 pm in our usual classroom.     During exams, you will not be allowed to use any electronic devices. You will be allowed bring a one-page sheet of notes which you can write yourself before the exam.     Grading    Component  Weight    Participation and Attendance  5%    Homework  40%    Midterm I  15%    Midterm II  18%    Final Exam  22%    Grades for the course will be curved at the end of the semester (most likely curved up). Because of how Canvas works, it is difficult to curve grades within that system, so any grades posted to Canvas will only reflect raw scores, not your actual letter grade. If you have questions about how you're doing in the class at any time, come chat with me or send me an email.

I want to make this class work for you, but I can't help unless I know what's going on. The best way to contact me is via email or to just stop by my office.
